# iLocate: An IoT Wearable Tracker Device with Health Analytics for Elders  , is our capstone (thesis).

Programming Language: Python

How the program works:

1. First you need MAX30102 sensor and Node MCU ESP 32 Module.
2. Then, you need to download Thonny IDE in this link https://thonny.org/
3. Next, you need to have an account in https://io.adafruit.com/
4. The following are the wiring of the MAX30102 in ESP 32 Module:
    
    MAX30102                  
    ESP 32 Module
    
      SDA                        
      Pin 22
      
      SCL                       
      Pin 21
      
      GND                        
      GND
      
      VCC                         
      3V
      
3. Execute and run the program in Thonny IDE.
4. Then put your index finger in the MAX30102, and it will detect your heart rate (BPM), Oxygen Saturation (SP02), and Body Temperature.
